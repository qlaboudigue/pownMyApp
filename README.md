Simplon brief about app security

## Assignment
The goal is to design and implement an app with security breaches such as :  
- XSS,  
- SQLI,  
- CSRF.  
Method to test the breach and How to solve that breach (Counter) is given in Results section.

## Set-up
App has been made using php 8.0, without any framework.  
It consists in one login.php page asking for login and password. Once submitted, the user might be redirected to the welcome.php page.  
Data are stored in a mySql database locally, in a table with the following structure :  
- id,  
- username,  
- password,  
- created_at
To test the app, user needs to set-up the database connection in the config.php file and replace ???? with related value :  
define('DB_SERVER', '????');  
define('DB_USERNAME', '????');  
define('DB_PASSWORD', '????');  
define('DB_NAME', '????');  

## Results
- XSS :  
Definition : XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The following one is a stored XSS.  
Action / Test : A user with username "<script>alert('XSS');</script>" has been created in the Database. When logged, the welcome.php page tries to display username and thus trigger <script> with the alert('XSS').  
Counter : When displaying the username in welcome.php, "echo $_SESSION["username"];"  must be replaced by "echo htmlspecialchars($_SESSION["username"]);"  
- SQLI :  
Definition : SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.  
Action / Test :  
Counter :
- CSRF :  
Definition : CSRF is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts.  
Action / Test :  
Counter :
